    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>In the current <a href="http://wg21.link/n4553">Concepts Technical Specification</a><sup>[1]</sup>, <code> R foo(ConceptName, ConceptName); </code> denotes a function that takes two arguments of the same type, with that type satisfying the concept <code>ConceptName</code>. More precisely, it's a shorthand for:
    <code>
    
    template &lt;ConceptName __C&gt;
    R foo(__C a, __C b);
    </code></p>
    <p>This paper argues that it would be more natural for it to denote a function that takes two arguments of potentially different types, with those types satisfying the concept <code>ConceptName</code>. That is, it should be a shorthand for:
    <code>
    
    template &lt;ConceptName __C1, ConceptName __C2&gt;
    R foo(__C1 a, __C2 b);
    </code>
    </p>
    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <h4>Follows from first principles</h4>
    <p>Once a developer has learned the basic language rule in Concepts that <code> ConceptName var </code> means that the variable <code>var</code> must have some type that models the concept <code>ConceptName</code>, the meaning of <code> ConceptName a, ConceptName b </code> should be obvious: that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> model <code>ConceptName</code> &mdash; no more, no less.</p>
    <p>It is surprising for the actual meaning to be "<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> model <code>ConceptName</code> <strong>and</strong> they have the same type". If this additional constraint is desired, it should be stated in the code.</p>
    <p>In other words, the interpretation this paper argues for is the one that follows from first principles. The authors believe this should be the guiding consideration.</p>
    <h4>Consistency with <code>auto</code></h4>
    <p><code>auto</code>, as standardized in C++14, already behaves the way we desire. That is,
    <code>
    
    R foo(auto a, auto b);
    </code></p>
    <p>is a shorthand for:
    <code>
    
    template &lt;typename __C1, typename __C2&gt;
    R foo(__C1 a, __C2 b);
    </code></p>
    <p>Since <code>auto</code> can be thought of as the weakest concept, it would make the language simpler and easier to teach if the way concepts behave is consistent with the way <code>auto</code> behaves.</p>
    <h4>Consistency with local variables</h4>
    <p>The current "same type" rule does not extend to local variables declared in the body of the function:
    <code>
    
    // a and b must have the same type, but var is allowed to be a different type
    R foo(ConceptName a, ConceptName b) {
      ConceptName var = /* ... */;
    }
    </code></p>
    <p>It is very confusing to for two of the three uses of <code>ConceptName</code> in this piece of code to have an additional constraint between them, but not the third.</p>
    <h4>Concepts are to types as types are to values</h4>
    <p>Concepts are to types as types are to values, in the sense that a concept defines a set of valid types much like a type defines a set of valid values. </p>
    <p>When we write <code> int x, int y </code>, <code>int</code> is a <em>type</em>, and the meaning is that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> both have <em>type</em> <code>int</code>; beyond that, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are not required to have the same <em>value</em>.</p>
    <p>Similar, when we write <code> ConceptName x, ConceptName y </code>, <code>ConceptName</code> is a <em>concept</em>, and the meaning is that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> both model the <em>concept</em> <code>ConceptName</code>; beyond that, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> should not be required to have the same <em>type</em>.</p>
    <h4>Iterator pairs are going out of fashion</h4>
    <p>One of the main arguments given for the current semantics is that having two arguments of the same (templated) type is very common in the standard library, due to iterator pairs.</p>
    <p>However, in a modern C++ world, this argument does not hold water. Thanks to the <a href="http://wg21.link/n4569">Ranges Technical Specification</a><sup>[2]</sup>, iterator pairs are going out of fashion, being replaced with iterator/sentinel pairs &mdash; which are two potentially <em>different</em> types &mdash; and single range objects.
    <h4>User confusion</h4>
    <p>Users have repeatedly expressed confusion about the current behaviour, indicating that it is not intuitive. Some examples:

      <li><a href="https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/#!topic/std-proposals/_YpRok7LaEU/discussion">std-proposals discussion</a><sup>[4]</sup></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/53i9a2/conceptlite_short_notation_problem/">Reddit question</a><sup>[5]</sup></li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>How would we express the old meaning?</h3>
    <p>What if one wants to express the old meaning of <code> foo(ConceptName,ConceptName) </code>, a function with two
    parameters of the same type that satisfies a concept? In addition to the non-terse notation:
    <code>
    
    template &lt;ConceptName C&gt;
    R foo(C a, C b);
    </code></p>
    <p>one could also write:
    <code>
    
    R foo(ConceptName a, decltype(a) b);
    </code>
    </p>
    <p>A third alternative would be provided by the syntax proposed in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3878.pdf">N3878</a><sup>[6]</sup>:
    <code>
    
    R foo(ConceptName{C} a, C b);
    </code></p>
    <p>Granted, the second two forms are not exactly equivalent, because the second parameter does not participate in deduction. One can envision a variation of the syntax proposed in N3878 which would mean "same type, and treated equally for deduction":
    <code>
    
    R foo(ConceptName{C} a, ConceptName{C} b);
    </code></p>
    <p>In any case, using notation available today, if equal treatment for deduction matters, the non-terse notation can be used.</p>
    <h3>Counter-arguments</h3>
    <p>It can be argued that you don't often want a function that takes two arguments of potentially different types satisfying the same concept without having an additional relationship between the two types.</p>
    <p>The authors believe that arguments like this based on frequency of use, should take a back seat to the arguments listed above, notably the argument based on first principles.</p>
    <p>However, even from a frequency point of view, it should be noted that a <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/#!topic/concepts/cdX4X0ngJqc/discussion">survey of standard library functions</a><sup>[7]</sup> found a significant amount of "same concept, different type" functions, comparable to the amount of "same concept, same type" functions when controlling for iterator pairs.</p>
