People in the "Concepts user feedback" reflector thread (resulting from Hal 
emailing authors of existing code using concepts on Github to ask them for 
feedback, and forwarding their feedback to the reflector) expressed support 
for P0464
  - Joseph Jevnik ("strongly support")
      - "I hadn't realized this wasn't already the case"
          - this is strong evidence that the proposed behaviour is the 
            intuitive one!
  - Christopher Di Bella
      - "I like this proposal. It is very much in line with my own thoughts, 
         and even covers some things that I've taken for granted or 
         overlooked."
      - "It wasn't until my talk at CppCon that I found out (mid-talk) that 
         this *isn't* how terse concepts behave."
  - Oleg Davydov
      - provided a new argument: the workaround to make the types the same
        ("template <ConceptName C> void foo(C, C)") is shorter than the 
        workaround to make the types different 
        ("template <ConceptName C1, ConceptName C2> void foo(C1, C2)")
  - aside: two authors, Maikel Nadolski and Christopher Di Bella, liked 
           Richard's N3878-like 
           "template <Concept [A, B, C]>" syntax, but suggested changing it to 
           "template <Concept{A, B, C}>" (i.e., the actual N3878 syntax) 
           instead
